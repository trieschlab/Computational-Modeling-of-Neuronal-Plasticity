    "Spike-Timing dependent Plasticity (STDP) is a type of neuronal activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, in which the strength of a synapse increases or decreases depending on the time difference between the pre- and postsynaptic spike (from now on we refer to these spikes as pre-spikes and post-spikes, respectively).\n",
    "While different subtypes of STDP can be found in the literature {cite}`abbott2000synaptic`, the most widely observed and discussed variety is ``Hebbian`` or asymmetric STDP, which entails long-term potentiation (LTP) after a pre-post spike pair, and long-term depression (LTD) of the synaptic weight after a post-pre spike pair.\n",

There are several possible variants of nearest-neihbor schemes reviewed by Morrison et al.  {cite}`morrison2008phenomenological`.

    "## Correlated Spike Trains\n",
    "\n",
    "When correlations between spike trains are nonzero, STDP can create additional competition between groups of synaptic inputs. Let us first see how we can implement such correlations in spike times. There are various ways to create correlations between spike trains, while maintaining Poisson-like statistics within the spike trains themselves. For example, here we are going to create Poisson spike trains that have instantaneous and exponential correlations with each other. We discuss one method, for creating such correlations, which has been described by Brette and colleagues \\cite{Brette2008} (Method II). \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a Poisson spike train $S_\\mathrm{source}$ with firing rate $r_\\mathrm{source}$. One way to create another spike train that has nonzero spike-time correlations with $S_\\mathrm{source}$ is to simply copy spike times from $S_\\mathrm{source}$ to the new spike train, which we call $S_\\mathrm{new}$. If the spikes are copied with probability $p$, then the firing rate of any new spike train will be $ p\\times r_\\mathrm{source} $. More generally,\n",

However according to equation 14, for any $p<1$, thinning of a Poisson spike train will result in $r_\\mathrm{new} < r_\\mathrm{source}$. What if we want the spike trains to have the same or higher firing rates? In order to compensate for the loss of spikes, the firing rate can be increased to reach $r_\\mathrm{target}$ by adding additional spikes. This is done by superimposing another Poisson spike train $S_\\mathrm{noise}$ onto $S_\\mathrm{new}$, with firing rate $r_\\mathrm{noise} = r_\\mathrm{target}- p \\times r_\\mathrm{source}$. If this process is repeated independently for a number of $S_\\mathrm{new}$  with the same $p$, $S_\\mathrm{source}$, and independent $S_\\mathrm{noise}$ for each spike train, one obtains a group of correlated spike trains that each fire with Poisson statistics and firing rate $r_\\mathrm{target}$.
