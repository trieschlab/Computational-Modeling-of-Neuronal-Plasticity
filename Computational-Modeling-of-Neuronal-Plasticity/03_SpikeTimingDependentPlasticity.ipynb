    "# Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP)\n",
    "## STDP\n",
    "Now we shall implement some long-term plasticity. Spike-Timing dependent Plasticity (STDP) is a type of neuronal activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, in which the strength of a synapse increases or decreases depending on the time difference between a spike from the presynaptic and a spike from the postsynaptic neuron (from now on we refer to these spikes as pre-spikes and post-spikes, respectively).\n",
    "While different subtypes of STDP can be found in the literature \\cite{Abbott2000}, the most widely observed and discussed variety is ``Hebbian`` or asymmetric STDP, which entails long-term potentiation (LTP) after a pre-post spike pair, and long-term depression (LTD) of the synaptic weight after a post-pre spike pair. Excitatory synapses in the hippocampus and cortex are subject to LTP and LTD via Hebbian STDP \\cite{Bi1998, Markram1997}."

These values, leading to a perfect compensation of LTP by LTD in terms of window area, are frequently used, though other values are possible. \n",
    "There are several ways to implement STDP in computational models distinguished by which pre- and post-synaptic spike pairs are allowed to interact to trigger changes in synaptic efficacies.  The two most often considered mechanisms are ``all-to-all,'' where every pre-synaptic spike interacts with every post-synaptic spike to trigger a weight change, and ``nearest-neighbour,'' where pre/post spikes only interact with the closest post/pre spikes. There are several possible variants of nearest-neihbor schemes reviewed by Morrison et al.\\ \\cite{morrison2008phenomenological}. Here, you should consider the ``narrow'' scheme depicted in Fig.~7 C of that publication. You can do this using two buffer variables that store the times of the last presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the single LIF neuron model from unit 1.4 (without refractory period or SRA), leave out the inhibitory inputs for simplicity, or set their synaptic weight to zero. Reduce the number of excitatory inputs to only 2 and apply the STDP rule, as shown in the figure and the equations above, in these two synapses. Importantly, set $A_{\\mathrm{LTP}}$ to 0.05 and $A_{\\mathrm{LTD}}$ to -0.025, such that the change in weight is slow enough for us to see the evolution of the weights. Note also that if the initial weight in combination with the input firing rate and the number of inputs is too weak, there will be no post-spikes. Without post-spikes, STDP is not activated and the weight will remain unchanged, so in this model the synaptic drive must be strong from the start of the simulation to see any effect of STDP. Here, use an initial value of $w_\\mathrm{e} = 1$ for each synapse, and apply two Poisson inputs with firing rate 5 Hz.\n",
    "Plot the value of the weight changing over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should now see that the weights are growing in an unlimited fashion. As a result of the growing weight, the postsynaptic neuron will demonstrate an increasing firing rate. This problem is dealt with in later units, for now just put a maximum weight value $w_\\mathrm{max}$ = 6, above which the weight cannot increase.\n",
    "Uncontrolled growth of synaptic weights is a property of pure additive STDP models in excitatory synapses: since the pre-post spike combination is related to potentiation, STDP rewards causality in the case of an excitatory synapse. The increased excitatory weight then enhances the probability that the pre-spike causes a post-spike, and hence a positive feedback loop is created. Therefore, the weight will mostly undergo LTP and little LTD, despite the integral of the STDP window being 0. Possible mechanisms that the brain employs to limit this positive feedback have been frequently addressed in the last decade in modeling studies concerned with STDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now change one of the Poisson inputs to a higher rate of 8 Hz. You now have two inputs with STDP, one with a higher and one with a lower firing rate (5 and 8 Hz). What do you see in the weights?  If it works well, the weight from the 8 Hz input should ``win the race''."

    "## Correlated Spike Trains\n",
    "\n",
    "When correlations between spike trains are nonzero, STDP can create additional competition between groups of synaptic inputs. Let us first see how we can implement such correlations in spike times. There are various ways to create correlations between spike trains, while maintaining Poisson-like statistics within the spike trains themselves. For example, here we are going to create Poisson spike trains that have instantaneous and exponential correlations with each other. We discuss one method, for creating such correlations, which has been described by Brette and colleagues \\cite{Brette2008} (Method II). \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a Poisson spike train $S_\\mathrm{source}$ with firing rate $r_\\mathrm{source}$. One way to create another spike train that has nonzero spike-time correlations with $S_\\mathrm{source}$ is to simply copy spike times from $S_\\mathrm{source}$ to the new spike train, which we call $S_\\mathrm{new}$. If the spikes are copied with probability $p$, then the firing rate of any new spike train will be $ p\\times r_\\mathrm{source} $. More generally,\n",

However according to equation 14, for any $p<1$, thinning of a Poisson spike train will result in $r_\\mathrm{new} < r_\\mathrm{source}$. What if we want the spike trains to have the same or higher firing rates? In order to compensate for the loss of spikes, the firing rate can be increased to reach $r_\\mathrm{target}$ by adding additional spikes. This is done by superimposing another Poisson spike train $S_\\mathrm{noise}$ onto $S_\\mathrm{new}$, with firing rate $r_\\mathrm{noise} = r_\\mathrm{target}- p \\times r_\\mathrm{source}$. If this process is repeated independently for a number of $S_\\mathrm{new}$  with the same $p$, $S_\\mathrm{source}$, and independent $S_\\mathrm{noise}$ for each spike train, one obtains a group of correlated spike trains that each fire with Poisson statistics and firing rate $r_\\mathrm{target}$.
