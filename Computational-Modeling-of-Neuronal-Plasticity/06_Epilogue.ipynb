    "Congratulations, you have completed the course! We hope you have learned a lot about neural plasticity mechanisms and how we can describe them mathematically and simulate them in a computer. Of course, what you have learned in this course is only a start. The much greater challenge is to understand how these, and other, plasticity mechanisms interact at the network level, allowing our brains to learn how to recognize faces or speak a language, or program neural network simulations, while always staying healthy and efficient. We hope you are as curious about these questions as we are.\n",
