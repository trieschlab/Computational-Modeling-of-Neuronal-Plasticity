    "# The Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron\n",
    "We will begin our course with the basics of the neuron model at the centre of this course, the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Neuron. We will try different inputs and spike input patterns, and see how they shape the response of the neuron. The LIF neuron model only gives a very simplified description of a neuron's behaviour. In reality neurons are very elaborate structures with complex dynamics of membrane voltage. The approximation with a single value for the membrane voltage is called a ''point-neuron'' and is very frequently used in neural network models. More about this neuron model can be found in the book Theoretical Neuroscience \\cite{Dayan2001}, section 5.4: ''Integrate-and-Fire Models''."

    "## A neuron with step current input\n",
    "We start with the simplest version of the LIF neuron, which receives a constant current input. Constant current inputs were used in classical electrophysiology experiments to detect basic properties of the neuronal membrane. \n",

    "\n",

    "\\tau_{\\mathrm{mem}} \\frac{dV}{dt} = E_\\mathrm{leak} - V + R_ \\mathrm{m} I_ \\mathrm{ext} . \n",

    "$E_\\mathrm{leak}$ is the reversal potential for the leak, -60 mV.\n",
    "$R_ \\mathrm{m}$ is the membrane resistance, 10 M$\\Omega$.\n",
    "Finally, $I_ \\mathrm{ext}$ is the external current applied to the neuron, 2.0 nA.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The neuron resets back to the reset value $V_\\mathrm{reset}$  =   -70 mV whenever its membrane voltage hits the threshold $V_\\mathrm{thresh}$  = -50 mV. Set the program to record an ''output spike'' every time $V$ hits the threshold. \n",
    "Using the above equation, make a simple python program to simulate a neuron for 200 ms, in response to 2.0 nA of constant applied current. \n",
    "Use Euler integration to solve the equations. It is helpful to make a separate python file in which the Euler integration is performed.\n",
    "At first, use an Euler integration time step of 0.1 ms. This integration time step will be looked at in more detail in a following section.\n",

    "Now add the inhibitory synapse to the neuron by combining equations (3-5), and assume periodic spikes with frequency 6 Hz for excitatory, and 3 Hz for inhibitory input synapses. Show the membrane potential of the neuron for 2 seconds.\n",
    "In order to obtain any spikes in the neuron, the excitatory synapse should be sufficiently strong. Therefore, set $w_\\mathrm{e} = $ 3.0, and $w_\\mathrm{i} =$ 3.0 to match. In following units we will deal with more realistic settings of multiple synaptic inputs.\n"

    "We now consider that the spikes the neuron receives resemble the irregular patters that are recorded in experiments. For example, a frequently used model for spike trains is the Poisson process. This means that spikes occur independently of each other.  If the average firing rate remains stable over time, it is called a homogeneous Poisson process, which is what we will apply here. Since a property of a Poisson spike train is that the inter-spike intervals are distributed exponentially, a sequence of input spike times can easily be obtained by randomly sampling inter-spike intervals from an exponential probability density function.\n",

If the distribution of ISIs follows an exponential shape, and if the coefficient of variation (CV, the standard deviation/mean) of the ISIs is 1, the output is irregular. A perfect Poisson process has exponentially distributed ISIs, and a CV of the ISIs of 1. If the CV of the ISIs deviates from 1, this can be a sign of more regular firing or bursting.\n",

Generally speaking,  input spike timing also plays a role, but we will not address this yet, as here all input spike trains are Poisson with stationary firing rates. \n",
    "Make sure to run a sufficiently long simulation or a number of separate shorter runs ('trials'), so that you have enough ISI datapoints to clearly see the distribution of ISIs. For the CV of the ISIs, try to obtain at least 50 independent trials of 10 seconds each, so that you have 50 CV datapoints for the distribution, where each CV is based on at least 20 ISIs. \n"
